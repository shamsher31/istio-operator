The ServiceMeshMemberRoll object configures which namespaces belong to a service mesh. Only namespaces listed in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll will be affected by the control plane. Any number of namespaces can be added, but a namespace may not exist in more than one service mesh. The ServiceMeshMemberRoll object must be created in the same namespace as the ServiceMeshControlPlane object and must be named "default".

| Name | Description | Type

| apiVersion
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
| string

| kind
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

ServiceMeshMemberRollStatus represents the current state of a ServiceMeshMemberRoll.

.Table ServiceMeshMemberRollStatus Fields

| Name | Description | Type

| annotations
| Annotations is an unstructured key value map used to store additional, usually redundant status information, such as the number of components deployed by the ServiceMeshControlPlane (number is redundant because you could just as easily count the elements in the ComponentStatus array). The reason to add this redundant information is to make it available to kubectl, which does not yet allow counting objects in JSONPath expressions.
